# Description
Creating a Student Enrollment Form using JSONPowerDB (JPDB) involves setting up a data structure to store student information in JSON format and using the JPDB API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB
JSONPowerDB (JPDB) is a NoSQL database system that offers several benefits for various applications and use cases. Some of the key advantages of using JSONPowerDB include:

Schema-less Data Storage: JSONPowerDB stores data in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is inherently schema-less. This means you can store and retrieve data without the need to define a fixed schema, making it highly flexible and accommodating changes in data structure over time.

High Performance: JSONPowerDB is designed for high-speed data retrieval and storage. It offers exceptional read and write performance, making it suitable for applications where low-latency data access is crucial.

Multimodel Database: JSONPowerDB supports multiple data models, including key-value, document, and column-family data models. This versatility allows you to store and retrieve data in various ways, depending on your application requirements.

ACID Compliant: JSONPowerDB ensures data integrity by providing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance. This means your data transactions are reliably processed and protected against inconsistencies.

REST API: JSONPowerDB offers a RESTful API that simplifies data manipulation and interaction. You can use standard HTTP methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it easy to integrate with various programming languages and platforms.
